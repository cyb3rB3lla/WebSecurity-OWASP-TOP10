In summary, our project focused on exploring and addressing web application security risks outlined in the OWASP Top 10 (2021). By utilizing tools like Kali Linux, OpenSense WAF, and BWAPP, we successfully tackled eight critical vulnerabilities, enhancing our understanding of cybersecurity.The choice of BWAPP as our testing platform allowed us to simulate real-world scenarios, and despite challenges, our team learned valuable lessons in security principles and mitigation techniques.Through source code improvements and strategic measures, such as enforcing least privilege and implementing strong encryption, we aimed to fortify web applications. Our practical social engineering (phishing) attack emphasized the importance of user awareness in cybersecurity.By navigating challenges and collaborating effectively, our team not only improved technical skills but also strengthened teamwork. Our project underscores the dynamic nature of cybersecurity and the need for continuous adaptation and improvement in defense strategies.In essence, our efforts contribute to a safer digital environment, emphasizing the importance of vigilance, best practices, and a culture of ongoing improvement in cybersecurity.
