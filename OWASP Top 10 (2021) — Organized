1. Broken Access Control
Description:
Occurs when access control policies are poorly implemented, allowing users to act outside their intended permissions.

Impact:

Unauthorized access to data, systems, or functions

Viewing, modifying, or deleting sensitive information

Privilege escalation

Prevention:

Enforce the principle of least privilege

Implement server-side access control checks

Deny by default unless explicitly allowed



2. Cryptographic Failures

Description:
Happens when sensitive data is not properly protected during storage or transmission.

Common Issues:

Plaintext storage

Weak or outdated algorithms

Reused or default keys

Invalid or untrusted certificates

Impact:

Data breaches

MITM attacks

Identity theft

Prevention:

Use modern encryption standards

Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest

Deploy strong SSL/TLS certificates




3. Injection

Description:
Occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, causing it to execute unintended commands (e.g., SQLi, XSS, command injection).

Common Causes:

Unsanitized user input

Dynamic queries without parameterization

String concatenation in queries

Impact:

Unauthorized data access

Data modification or deletion

Server compromise

Prevention:

Validate and sanitize all inputs

Use prepared statements and parameterized queries

Apply filtering and secure coding practices





4. Insecure Design

Description:
Security weaknesses caused by flawed design rather than poor implementation.

Common Causes:

Insecure SDLC practices

Vulnerable components

Poor business logic

Insufficient threat modeling

Impact:

Data exposure

Application compromise

Logic manipulation

Prevention:

Integrate security early in the SDLC

Use secure components only

Perform continuous testing and risk profiling





5. Security Misconfiguration

Description:
Occurs when security settings are incorrect, incomplete, or left at insecure defaults.

Common Issues:

Unnecessary services enabled

Default passwords/configurations

Outdated components

Overly detailed error messages

Impact:

Unauthorized access

System compromise

Prevention:

Apply consistent hardening standards

Remove unnecessary features

Keep configurations updated





6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Description:
Using libraries, frameworks, or software versions with known vulnerabilities.

Common Issues:

No component inventory

Missing updates/patches

Using deprecated versions

Impact:

Wide range of attacks

Weak security posture

Prevention:

Continuous vulnerability scanning

Apply updates immediately

Track component versions






7. Identification and Authentication Failures

Description:
Failures in verifying user identity or managing sessions securely.

Common Issues:

Weak or default passwords

Missing MFA

Poor session management

Impact:

Account takeover

Unauthorized access

Prevention:

Strong password policies

Enforce MFA

Secure session IDs and tokens







8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

Description:
Occurs when code, updates, or data pipelines do not protect against integrity violations.

Common Issues:

Insecure CI/CD pipelines

Untrusted dependencies

Insecure deserialization

Impact:

Code execution

System compromise

Malware injection

Prevention:

Use trusted sources

Add integrity checks

Implement secure update mechanisms






9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Description:
Lack of proper logging and monitoring makes detecting attacks difficult.

Common Issues:

Missing audit logs

Logs not reviewed

No alerting or response plan

Impact:

Undetected breaches

Long response times

Prevention:

Implement centralized logging

Monitor critical events

Develop incident response procedures






10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Description:
Occurs when applications fetch external resources without validating user input.

Impact:

Bypassing firewalls/VPNs

Unauthorized internal access

Remote code execution

Prevention:

Validate all URLs

Enforce network segmentation

Use allowlists
