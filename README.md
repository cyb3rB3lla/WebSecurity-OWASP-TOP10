# WebSecurity-OWASP-TOP10
The main goals of this project are to demonstrate attacks linked to the OWASP Top 10 (2021) vulnerabilities, highlight mitigation methods such as source code enhancements, and carry out a practical social engineering (phishing) attack. A Web Application Firewall (WAF), a Kali Attacker, and a Kali Victim running BWAPP—a purposefully vulnerable web application selected for its ability to replicate real-world scenarios—were the three Kali Linux computers that made up our network configuration. Because BWAPP covers a wide range of vulnerabilities, it was an ideal choice for our study. This made its selection important.
The main goal was to use the Kali Attacker machine to carry out attacks on BWAPP that were in line with the OWASP Top 10 (2021), and to use the Kali Victim machine to carry out mitigation strategies through source code modifications. To evaluate weaknesses and reactions, we also ran a mock social engineering (phishing) attack. Despite the difficulties, our four-student team handled complexities with fortitude, turning setbacks into teaching moments. Even though the journey was difficult, we enjoyed ourselves and bonded as we worked toward our goals.
